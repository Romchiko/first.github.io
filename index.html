								<h2><a href = "#">The Evolving Role of Social Media in News Organizations [LIVE Q&amp;A] </a></h2>

								<p>A few years ago, news organizations were unsure about social. Journalists were apprehensive to create Twitter accounts and media companies questioned whether a branded Passbook fan page was necessaryNowadays those uncertainties are irrelevant. Social media has become the driving force of many news organizations' digital strategies. They don't just want to have a presence on the social web — they want to make the most of it.That's why some newsrooms have hired social media editors and community managers to guide their social media approach. Still, the day-to-day tasks of these employees differs from organization to organization. </p>

								<p>Battlefield series games usually focus on large, online multiplayer battles, but the series included a new Cops-vs-Robbers theme with the release of Battlefield Hardline. This title did not have nearly the emphasis on piloting vehicles as previous titles, yet there still were a number of vehicles as well as team-based infantry combat. Playing in squads has also become a major element of games in the series.Since Battlefield 2, all games in the series centrally record online statistics for each player allowing the players to receive rank promotions and weapon unlocks based on their statistics as well as awards such as medals, ribbons and pins.A class system has been present within all the Battlefield games. Each class features a different type of primary weapon along with different equipment, differentiating roles on the battlefield.The ability to melee other players with a knife has always been present in Battlefield games. Also since Battlefield 2142, the series has included an award of dog tags for each player killed using a knife.</p>

								<p>The role of teacher is often formal and ongoing, carried out at a school or other place of formal education. In many countries, a person who wishes to become a teacher must first obtain specified professional qualifications or credentials from a university or college. These professional qualifications may include the study of pedagogy, the science of teaching. Teachers, like other professionals, may have to continue their education after they qualify, a process known as continuing professional development. Teachers may use a lesson plan to facilitate student learning, providing a course of study which is called the curriculum.A teacher's role may vary among cultures. Teachers may provide instruction in literacy and numeracy, craftsmanship or vocational training, the arts, religion, civics, community roles, or life skills.A teacher who facilitates education for an individual may also be described as a personal tutor, or, largely historically, a governess.In some countries, formal education can take place through home schooling. Informal learning may be assisted by a teacher occupying a transient or ongoing role, such as a family member, or by anyone with knowledge or skills in the wider community setting</p>

								<h2><a href = "#">Apple Gives Its Key Execs $400 Million in Bonuses</a></h2>

								<p>Eddy Cue, the recently promoted SVP of Internet Software and Services, received 100,000 instead of 150,000 like Apple's other SVPs. However, Cue received 100,000 shares when he was first promoted to SVP in September. Each 100,000 stock grant is worth $40 million.Apple's execs won't be able to spend their new-found wealth immediately, though. Fifty percent of Forstall, Mansfield, Oppenheimer, Schiller, Williams and Sewell's shares will vest in June 2012, while the other half will vest in March 2016. Cue is on a different vesting schedule: 25% of his shares will vest in September 2014, while the other 75% will vest in September 2016."Our executive team is incredibly talented and they are all dedicated to Apple's continued success," an Apple spokesperson said in a statement. "These stock grants are meant to reward them down the road for their hard work in helping to keep Apple the most innovative company in the world." </p>

								<p>Some companies are afraid to set up Facebook pages because they allow customers to comment, which means someone might write something negative. It seems counterintuitive, but you should actually want customers to complain on your company's Facebook page. If your customers are complaining about you on their personal, privacy-protected Facebook profiles, you have no way to know if they're complaining, much less reach out to them and make it right.When customers complain on your brand's Facebook page, you can respond and resolve issues. If you do it right (and get a little lucky), unhappy customers will turn their opinions around and recommend you to friends because of your fantastic customer service. </p>
